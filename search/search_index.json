We are interested in several domains of computing, including network communication protocols, operating systems, distributed systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, and embedded devices. Software of computer networks and systems continues to have exploitable vulnerabilities, which are lucrative targets for adversaries. Within this broad domain, our particular emphasis is on automated detection of vulnerabilities as well as creating resilient protocols and systems. Our research primarily builds on and expands program analysis, software testing, and formal verification. </p>"},{"location":"#key-topics","title":"Key Topics","text":"<p>Network security, system security, software testing, IoT security</p>"},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p> CST 4-122, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Syracuse University, NY</p>"},{"location":"members/","title":"Members of SYNE Lab","text":""},{"location":"members/#faculty","title":"Faculty","text":"<p> Endadul Hoque <p>Assistant Professor <p></p>"},{"location":"members/#current-students","title":"Current Students","text":"<p> Md Mahbub Alam <p>PhD student <p></p> <p> Siwei Zhang <p>PhD student <p></p> <p> Polina Kozyreva <p>PhD student <p></p> <p> Altin Gjonbalaj <p>MS student <p></p> <p> Manthan Ghasadiya <p>MS student <p></p> <p> Eric Rodriguez <p>Undergraduate student <p></p> <p> Kritika Verma <p>Undergraduate student <p></p> <p> Joshua Lim <p>Undergraduate student <p></p> <p> John Peters <p>Undergraduate student <p></p>"},{"location":"members/#past-students","title":"Past Students","text":"<ul> <li>Akib Nafis - PhD student (Aug 2021 - Jan 2024, Graduated with a MS)</li> <li>S Mahmudul Hasan - PhD student (Aug 2021 - Jan 2024, Graduated with a MS)</li> <li>Li Li - PhD student (Jan 2020 \u2013 May 2022, Graduated with an MS)</li> <li>Genesis Alvarez - Undergraduate student (Jun 2023 - Jul 2023)</li> <li>Zhiyi Chen - MS student (Jan 2022 \u2013 Aug 2022, currently at AWS)</li> <li>Husen Bhagat - MS student (Apr 2020 \u2013 Aug 2020)</li> <li>Neil Malu - MS student (Mar 2020 \u2013 Aug 2020)</li> <li>Yixing Chen - Undergraduate student (Summer 2020)</li> <li>David Hadley - Undergraduate student (Summer 2020)</li> <li>Proyash Podder - PhD student @FIU (Aug 2018 \u2013 Jul 2019)</li> <li>Bohdan Dovhan - MS student @ FIU (Aug 2018 \u2013 Apr 2019)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"photos/","title":"Photos","text":""},{"location":"photos/#april-2024","title":"April 2024","text":"Group dinner at Schine Center, Apr 2024.

These adversaries employ crafted inputs to exploit undisclosed or unpatched security flaws (bugs) in protocol implementations. Despite the common strategy of bug identification and patching, unearthing elusive bugs in protocol implementations remains challenging as it requires navigating stringent input validation to discover bugs that lurk deep in the code. Fuzzing automates security testing by passing abnormal inputs to programs in order to discover bugs. While fuzzing has effectively uncovered bugs in many real-world systems, it still struggles to generate inputs essential for testing complex code logic. This project bridges this gap in traditional fuzzing by developing an innovative automated solution that effectively enhances the testing of protocol implementations.</p>"},{"location":"projects/csfuzz/#publications","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"projects/csfuzz/#people","title":"People","text":"<ul> <li>Endadul Hoque</li> <li>Mahbub Alam</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/csfuzz/#funding-source","title":"Funding Source","text":"<p>Google Research </p>"},{"location":"projects/parapet/","title":"Parapet","text":""},{"location":"projects/parapet/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>The recent advancement in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) domain has substantially transformed many important sectors (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, smart-home) by introducing programmable IoT platforms to fulfill their varying business needs. Such programmable platforms facilitate a user to bring together a collection of low-powered IoT devices to automatically carry out customized tasks at hand by installing various native and third-party automation apps. Unfortunately, many of these existing programmable IoT platforms do not provide adequate in-built security measures (e.g., fine-grained access control) to thwart risks from misbehaving (rogue/faulty) apps. As a result, a misbehaving app can exercise unrestricted access to the devices and thus, transition the IoT system to an undesirable and/or unsafe state. This can lead to financial loss, fatal consequences, or environmental disasters. This project focuses on defending IoT systems against such threats by preventing native and third-party apps from administering unexpected operations on IoT devices. The project develops a platform-agnostic solution, which has the potential to substantially improve the overall security, privacy and safety of existing programmable IoT systems. The foundational techniques developed in this project are also applicable to a variety of networked systems (e.g., mission-/safety-critical systems)</p>"},{"location":"projects/parapet/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<ul><li><p> ,              \",\" , (),  (editors), , , , vol. , (),  pp. , , .                  \u2003DOI:  <p>"},{"location":"projects/parapet/#people","title":"People","text":"<ul> <li>Endadul Hoque</li> <li>Mahbub Alam </li> <li>Kritika Verma</li> <li>Eric Rodriguez</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/parapet/#past-members","title":"Past Members","text":"<ul> <li>Akib Nafis</li> <li>S Mahmudul Hasan</li> <li>Li Li</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/parapet/#funding-source","title":"Funding Source","text":"<p>NSF CNS-2007512</p>"},{"location":"projects/template/","title":"Project Name","text":""},{"location":"projects/template/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Description goes here</p>"},{"location":"projects/template/#publications","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"projects/template/#people","title":"People","text":"<ul> <li>name</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/template/#past-members","title":"Past Members","text":"<ul> <li>name1</li> <li>name2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/template/#funding-source","title":"Funding Source","text":""}]}
